# systemVerilogTestFramework
Gtest style test framework for system verilog.

# Introduction
As much as I like gtest for C++, building a gtest wrapper for system verilog
didnt make much sense. So I built my own gtest clone for system verilog using
the constructs provided to me by the language. This is meant to be a lightweight
test bench wrapper to provide a "framework" of organization to SV test benches
and encourage the usage of software engineering methodologies in the hardware
world.
